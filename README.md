## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, a Frontend Engineer working mainly with Javascript, React.js and Three.js.
I love building new cutting-edge projects for customers who want to push the boundaries of the web (3D WebGL, VR WebXR, blockchain dApp Web3, ...).


## Last project

I'm currently working for Broadcast Industry for live production @evs-broadcast  (FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, eSports, Fox Sport SuperBowl, ...),
but I'm also building cool projects for other customers.

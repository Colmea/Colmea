## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, a Frontend Engineer working mainly with Javascript, React.js and Three.js.
I love building new cutting-edge projects for customers who want to push the boundaries of the web (3D WebGL, VR WebXR, blockchain dApp Web3, ...).


## Last project

I'm currently working for Broadcast Industry for live production @evs-broadcast  (FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, eSports, Fox Sport SuperBowl, ...),
but I'm also building cool projects for other customers.


### Syngenta Field Of Innovation

Syngenta's Field Of Innovation is a big annual event in... real life. Unfortunately, COVID-19 force them to re-think their event. And this is how Virtual Field Of Innovation came to life.

Full React.js project with react-three-fiber (React renderer for Three.js). Challenging but exciting project !

## Last personnal project

When I have free time, I love building new projects. Sometimes to learn a new tech, but most of the time just for fun.

### Alkito Javascript MMORPG

* :star: Stack: Javascript, Phaser.js, React.js (UI), Node.js Express, Websocket (socket.io).
* :earth_asia: https://alkito.herokuapp.com/
